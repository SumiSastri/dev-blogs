## Disclaimer

I have only been a web developer for a few years and there are many people better suited to write more eruditely on the subject. My tech blogs, are aimed at readers with no experience or knowledge of tech to demystify a profession that is so full of jargon and obfuscation. 

I am currently studying for a masters in computer science and these docs serve as a study guide. I am in the process of updating references, this is a work in progress, so all blogs may not have updated references. These blogs do not cover mobile app development as it is not in the scope of my expertise or knowledge base.

I am using these blogs as an experimental environment for adding citations to these blogs, this is a work in progress My dev blogs are for guidance only, and a part of my self-education. 

If there are errors, they are entirely my fault so please do your research. If you find any information incomplete or incorrect connect with me on Linked-in or GitHub and raise an issue if you would like me to fix anything - always happy to collaborate and be corrected :-).

Not all sections have been updated with a bibliography.
