# dev-blogs

Hi I am Sumi, I am full-stack JavaScript developer with some knowledge of Python. I have only been in the industry for a couple of years and there are many people better suited to write more eruditely on the subject of tech.

My tech blogs, are aimed at readers with no experience or knowledge of tech, to understand the journey of someone who is neither a computer scientist, nor a software engineer.

It is also aimed at non-tech readers to demystify a profession that is so full of jargon and obfuscation to clear the fog and understand the journey that I took to become a web developer/ software engineer.

My only excuse for being here is I love what I do. I hope some part of this content helps you understand a day in the life of a code writer... at least, that's the way I define myself to my friends and family.
