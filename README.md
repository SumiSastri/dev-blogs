# dev-blogs

My dev blogs are for guidance only. I am currently studying for a masters in computer science and these docs serve as a study guide.

If there are errors they are entirely my fault so please do your own research if you find any information incomplete or incorrect.

Connect with me on Linked-in or GitHub and raise and issue if you would like me to fix anything - always happy to collaborate and be corrected :-).
