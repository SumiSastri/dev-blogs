Read the getting started guide: [https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-repository]

1. Go to your repository and click the Security button to see all the features:

2. A simple way to keep your code secure is to make your repository private - go to the settings cog

[https://github.com/SumiSastri/html-css-js-projects/settings]

Go to the Danger Zone and change visibility to private. However, this means some features like archiving the repository will get lost.

Read more about what gets lost in the change[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility]

3. There are more advanced security measures you can add to repository to keep secrets safe/ code scanning that come at a cost.

Code scanning is a feature that you use to analyze the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. Any problems identified by the analysis are shown in GitHub.
