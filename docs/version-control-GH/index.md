# GitHub and version control

Writing software is an iterative process of writing and improving the code base.

Tooling and version control systems (VCS) come into play. This section primarily deals with GitHub and (GIT) an acronym for Global Information Tracker, also shortened to the proper noun, Git.

Please set up your [local environment](https://sumisastri.github.io/dev-blogs/dev-environment/) before you can proceed to this section as it will be much easier to follow along.
