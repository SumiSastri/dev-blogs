# AWS CDK

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a stack that allows you to define the AWS resources you are using in your app as code. It is part of the managed-services of AWS allowing you to write your infrastructure as code.

[An example repo in my portfolio](https://github.com/SumiSastri/nextjs-aws-app/tree/main/packages/aws-cdk-demo-app) to follow and see how the code works.
