__Checked exceptions__

Checked exception are those that compiler forces you to use a try-catch block 
An error that you can not ignore - file to open - does the file exist? if you open illegal file for example it could cause a disc errors that can not be recovered from
(IOException)

Try - code that might generate error
Catch - deal with the error
Finally - default execution

Finally block - release resources - closes the writer
Prevents memory leaks
