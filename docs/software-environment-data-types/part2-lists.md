Lists are multiple sets of data. A word, for example is a list of primitive characters. As the words must be in a particular order to make sense, words are ordered lists.

If a list does not need to be stored in a strict order, it may be stored in an unordered list.

Different programming languages have different names for lists. In JavaScript, for example an ordered list is an array. An unordered list is an object. In Python a set is an unordered list. 

Descriptions such as collections, sort lists, indexed lists are all variations to the names given to ordered and unordered lists in a programming language.
