Once data has been created in a program, it needs to be allocated to memory in a computer or in a cloud-based storage system.

All programming languages therefore have a storage type called a variable. The variable stores the data for future usage.

If the data is unlikely to change the variable holds immutable - or data that does not change.

If the data is likely to change - for example, if a name is spelt incorrectly and needs to be changed or updated, then this data must have mutability - or the ability of a programmer to change its initial state.

To differentiate between these variables, JavaScript has two types of variables the `let` variable and the `const` variable. The `let` variable allows the data to be mutated or changed, while the `const` holds a constant state of data - or data that is immutable and does not change.

Java, Python, C and other programming languages will have their own key words that define a variable.
