# Tech blogs

Hi I am Sumi, after a 3-month bootcamp in 2019, a short stint in industry in 2020, I now work as a JavaScript & TypeScript developer in tech-for-good.

From 2009 to 2019, I worked as a tech project delivery manager and product owner for demanding clients like S&P Global Ratings, Private Equity International, the British Standards Institute in London and Middle East Business Intelligence(MEED) in Dubai. There were consumer tech projects with Hearst Magazines UK to put the first digital publications on the Apple Newsstand. At the other end of the spectrum, were tiny startups in edutech with Third Space Learning a maths tutorial platform, amongst other small to medium size business and charitable organisations that I consulted with.

From defining specs to building features the shift was seismic. After consulting as a knowledge expert in digital transformation, to start again from a point of blissful ignorance as an intern, was tough.

I have only been in the industry for a few years and there are many people better suited to write more eruditely on the subject of tech.

My tech blogs, are aimed at readers with no experience or knowledge of tech, to understand the journey of someone who is neither a computer scientist, nor a software engineer.

It is also aimed at non-tech readers to demystify a profession that is so full of jargon and obfuscation. The blogs are written in plain English, free of jargon, or where jargon used it is explained in simple terms to clear the fog.

### Disclaimer

My only excuse for being here is I love what I do. I hope some part of this content helps you understand a day in the life of a code writer... at least, that's the way I define myself to my friends and family.

My dev blogs are for guidance only, and a part of my self-education. 

If there are errors they are entirely my fault so please do your own research if you find any information incomplete or incorrect.

Connect with me on Linked-in or GitHub and raise and issue if you would like me to fix anything - always happy to collaborate and be corrected :-).
