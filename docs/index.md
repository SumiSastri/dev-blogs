# Tech blogs

Hi I am Sumi, I am a JavaScript & TypeScript web-developer in tech-for-good, currently studing part-time at Westminster University - a conversion MSc, Computer Science (2024-2026).

From 2009 to 2019, I worked as a tech project delivery manager and product owner for demanding clients like S&P Global Ratings, Private Equity International, the British Standards Institute in London and Middle East Business Intelligence(MEED) in Dubai. There were consumer tech projects with Hearst Magazines UK to put the first digital publications on the Apple Newsstand. At the other end of the spectrum, were tiny startups in edutech with Third Space Learning a maths tutorial platform, amongst other small to medium size business and charitable organisations that I consulted with.

From defining specs to building features the shift was seismic. After consulting as a knowledge expert in digital transformation, to start again from a point of blissful ignorance I did a 3-month bootcamp in 2019, a short stint in industry in 2020, before I started working in the third sector in 2021.


## Disclaimer

I have only been a web developer for a few years and there are many people better suited to write more eruditely on the subject. My tech blogs, are aimed at readers with no experience or knowledge of tech to demystify a profession that is so full of jargon and obfuscation. 

I am currently studying for a masters in computer science and these docs serve as a study guide. I am in the process of updating references, this is a work in progress, so all blogs may not have updated references. These blogs do not cover mobile app development as it is not in the scope of my expertise or knowledge base.

I am using these blogs as an experimental environment for adding citations to these blogs, this is a work in progress My dev blogs are for guidance only, and a part of my self-education. 

If there are errors, they are entirely my fault so please do your research. If you find any information incomplete or incorrect connect with me on Linked-in or GitHub and raise an issue if you would like me to fix anything - always happy to collaborate and be corrected :-).

_NOTE: References for research are noted by hyperlinks within the text body, or in sections on further reading & resources at the end of a blog, I am compiling a master reading list of texts as part of my master's education which can be found in the file `rsources.md`_ at the end of every section. Not all sections have been updated with a bibliography.
