Hi, I am Sumi. I am a full-stack developer currently in my final semester of an Msc in Software Engineering at the University of Westminster.

From 2009 to 2019, I worked as a tech project delivery manager and product owner for demanding clients like S&P Global Ratings, Private Equity International, the British Standards Institute, in London, and Middle East Business Intelligence(MEED) in Dubai.

There were consumer tech projects, including collaborations with Hearst Magazines UK, to launch the first digital publications on the Apple Newsstand and automate the renewal process for TIME magazine's European subscriptions.

At the other end of the spectrum were tiny startups in edutech, with Third Space Learning a maths tutorial platform, amongst other small to medium-sized businesses and charitable organisations.

After consulting as a knowledge expert in digital transformation, I did a 3-month web-development bookcamp in 2019. From defining specs to building features, the shift was seismic. Working as a developer, I value the hands-on experience and enrolled in this master's to graduate with a toolkit that enables a deeper understanding of my day job.

## DISCLAIMER

These docs are primarily a study guide written in plain English and explain, where possible, industry jargon. If there are errors, they are entirely my fault so please do your research.

I am experimenting with adding reading references and resources to these blogs where approprite. Many references are added without academia in mind. These references are a list of links to sources of information that readers may find useful.

If you find any information incomplete or incorrect connect with me on Linked-in or GitHub. I am always happy to collaborate and be corrected :-). 

This is a work in progress, so not all sections are updated with citations, references and links.
