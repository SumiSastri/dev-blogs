# Home - Teach yourself to code

Hi I am Sumi, a full-stack developer. I did a bootcamp to learn to code. But you can do it yourself, with no experience.

The only pre-requisite is wanting to learn to code and then enjoying it. Like everything, when you teach yourself, have a play. Do whatever you want, break the code, start again.

Follow the guidelines without being a slave to them.

I like to document what I learn as I find technical documentation can be overwhelming - and sometimes I only need the bits I need to know. This is my learning journey and I hope these blogs will inspire you to keep learning!

The good news is, learning never stops and there are many better blogs, better courses, better ways of learning, better & smarter developers - this is just my way. I hope you enjoy your stay.
