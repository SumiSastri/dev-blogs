Hi I am Sumi, I am a full-stack developer currently studing part-time at Westminster University - a conversion MSc, Computer Science (2024-2026).

From 2009 to 2019, I worked as a tech project delivery manager and product owner for demanding clients like S&P Global Ratings, Private Equity International, the British Standards Institute, in London, and Middle East Business Intelligence(MEED) in Dubai.

There were consumer tech projects, with Hearst Magazines UK, to put the first digital publications on the Apple Newsstand or autmating the renewals process for TIME magazine's European subscriptions.

At the other end of the spectrum, were tiny startups in edutech with Third Space Learning a maths tutorial platform, amongst other small to medium size business and charitable organisations that I consulted with.

From defining specs to building features the shift was seismic. After consulting as a knowledge expert in digital transformation, to start again from a point of blissful ignorance I did a 3-month bootcamp in 2019, a short stint in industry in 2020, before I started working in the third sector in 2021.

## DISCLAIMER

My dev blogs are for guidance only, and a part of my self-education. If there are errors, they are entirely my fault so please do your research.

I have only been a web developer for a few years and there are many people better suited to write more eruditely on the subject.  I am currently studying for a Masters in Computer Science at Westminster University. These docs are primarily a study guide written in plain English and explain, where possible, industry jargon.

I am experimenting with adding reading references and resources to these blogs where approprite. Many references are added without academia in mind. These references are a list of links to sources of information that readers may find useful.

If you find any information incomplete or incorrect connect with me on Linked-in or GitHub. I am always happy to collaborate and be corrected :-). This is a work in progress, so not all sections are updated with citations, references and links.
