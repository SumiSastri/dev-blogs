# DNS - The Domain Name System

The Domain Name System (DNS),is a directory of the names of all registered web domains. DNS, is also confusingly, referred to as name server/ domain system server or DSS.

The DNS matches the URLs (unique-resource-locators) of a web page, the name of the website to the IP (internet protocol) associated with the webpage

The IP address is a string of numbers, which is hard for users to remember, and the IP address is stored in the URL, also long and hard to remember. So users can assign memorable names to websites they want to own and register them with the DNS system. The DNS is used to point the websites URL to its IP address.

The DNS is a network that connects billions of users to their internet services and this section breaks down the complexity of the system into some of the key operations of the DNS.
