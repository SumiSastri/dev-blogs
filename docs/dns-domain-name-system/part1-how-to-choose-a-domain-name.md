# How to choose a domain name

To choose a domain name, it is useful to understand how the  Domain Name System (DNS) works.

The DNS is set into motion when searches are carried out for web pages by a computer or any other device (client). The search is sent to a server. Device use a browsers to search servers.

The browser sends a request to a server to look up the DNS network.

The network of servers are connected by underground pipes/ cables that send packets of information from the client to the servers to the DNS that can be located anywhere in the world.

Each name for a website or page is stored in an URL (Unique Resource Locator). This search is sent from the client to the browser to the server to look up the unique IP associated with it. This is also termed as a forward DNS look-up.
If you type the IP address and ask for the domain name (URL) this is known as a reverse DNS look-up.

When a user types in a URL, the request (from the client) is sent via the browser through the network of computers to find the hosting service of the DNS.

Everything that is connected to the internet has an IP address. An IP address connects each unique device to the internet - be it a mobile phone/ smart device / website.

Browsers and the browser engines help you search through this directory. Chrome, Edge, Opera, Safari, Yahoo, Mozilla are all performing the same basic function - finding a URL by its name and connecting it to its IP address by searching the DNS for the user.

This address then can be stored in the local memory of your computer or the memory of the browser engine and ultimately it is stored with a web-host.

A host, stores all of this information and rents out space on the servers they pay for as each individual would find it difficult to have a server in their own homes, or even in offices some companies now do not store all of this information on servers on their premises (known as on-prem). Instead they choose to store information on a server that is accessed by the internet or cloud.

If you are building a website, the first pre-requisite is to choose a name for your website and register it with the DNS. To purchase a name, it must not already be owned by somebody else and you have to choose a unique name. To do this you may have to purchase it from a 3rd-party that already subscribes to the DNS system and you can check if the name you have chosen is unique and purchase it.

As this is a lucrative business, names are only sold for a period of time on a subscription basis and you have to pay for to renew your ownership of the name every year, or the length of time you choose to prucahse your web name for.

Often hosting services sell names as well - for example, if you use GoDaddy/ BlueHost/ AWS, the request will reach the GoDaddy servers or the BlueHost servers to find your website, or the web name you are seeking to purchase.

If you change your web host to AWS then the request will go to the Amazon Web Services servers to find your website. There is often a fee to migrate your name to a new host.

## How to choose a domain name service provider

A domain name can have different extensions .com/ .org/ etc. Domain names gives content-creators control over the content they want to publish across the internet.

ICANN, [International Corporation for Assigned Names & Numbers](https://lookup.icann.org/), is the intenational directory, that the DNS refers to, for web names to make sure there are no duplication of IP-addresses (the number relating to your domain name) or the actual name itself. ICANN's principal job is to reconcile the name of the site with the IP number and publish it in an internationally accessible directory. This is used both by the DNS and hosting companies.

If you are a content creator you will need to purchase a domain name and there are several resellers of domain names that are linked to ICANN allowing you to buy domain names and connect to the registry maintained by ICANN.

Any domain name service provider allows you to purchase a domain name. How do you chose between them? 

Depending on your needs. If you want a site on a short term basis the cheapest service provider is great. 

If you want to maintain a brand and get additional services doing some research on hosting services combined with domain name purchases is a good investment in time.

Sometimes, you may just want to purchase a domain name and think about the rest of the process - hosting, designing and maintaining your site - after you have purchased the name. Since this takes time, it is worth just purchasing a name and not purchasing hosting at all. Once again, the cheapest service works best till you have a design, architecture and plan for your content.
