# How to choose a domain name

To choose a domain name, it is useful to understand how the  Domain Name System (DNS) works.

The DNS is set into motion when searches are carried out for web pages by a computer or any other device (client). The search is sent to a server. Device use a browsers to search servers.

The browser sends a request to a server to look up the DNS network.

The network of servers are connected by underground pipes/ cables that send packets of information from the client to the servers to the DNS that can be located anywhere in the world.

Each name for a website or page is stored in an URL (Unique Resource Locator). This search is sent from the client to the browser to the server to look up the unique IP associated with it. This is also termed as a forward DNS look-up.
If you type the IP address and ask for the domain name (URL) this is known as a reverse DNS look-up.

When a user types in a URL, the request (from the client) is sent via the browser through the network of computers to find the hosting service of the DNS.

Everything that is connected to the internet has an IP address. An IP address connects each unique device to the internet - be it a mobile phone/ smart device / website.

Browsers and the browser engines help you search through this directory. Chrome, Edge, Opera, Safari, Yahoo, Mozilla are all performing the same basic function - finding a URL by its name and connecting it to its IP address by searching the DNS for the user.

This address then can be stored in the local memory of your computer or the memory of the browser engine and ultimately it is stored with a web-host.

A host, stores all of this information and rents out space on the servers they pay for as each individual would find it difficult to have a server in their own homes, or even in offices some companies now do not store all of this information on servers on their premises (known as on-prem). Instead they choose to store information on a server that is accessed by the internet or cloud.

If you are building a website, the first pre-requisite is to choose a name for your website and register it with the DNS. To purchase a name, it must not already be owned by somebody else and you have to choose a unique name. To do this you may have to purchase it from a 3rd-party that already subscribes to the DNS system and you can check if the name you have chosen is unique and purchase it.

As this is a lucrative business, names are only sold for a period of time on a subscription basis and you have to pay for to renew your ownership of the name every year, or the length of time you choose to prucahse your web name for.

Often hosting services sell names as well - for example, if you use GoDaddy/ BlueHost/ AWS, the request will reach the GoDaddy servers or the BlueHost servers to find your website, or the web name you are seeking to purchase.

If you change your web host to AWS then the request will go to the Amazon Web Services servers to find your website. There is often a fee to migrate your name to a new host.

[NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/dns/what-is-dns-domain-name-system-definition/), sells domain names and has an overview of what the DNS is, to guide users on how to purchase a suitable web-name and how the DNS works.

## How to choose a domain name service provider

A domain name can have different extensions .com/ .org/ etc. Domain names gives content-creators control over the content they want to publish across the internet.

ICANN, [International Corporation for Assigned Names & Numbers](https://lookup.icann.org/), is the intenational directory, that the DNS refers to, for web names to make sure there are no duplication of IP-addresses (the number relating to your domain name) or the actual name itself. ICANN's principal job is to reconcile the name of the site with the IP number and publish it in an internationally accessible directory. This is used both by the DNS and hosting companies.

If you are a content creator you will need to purchase a domain name and there are several resellers of domain names that are linked to ICANN allowing you to buy domain names and connect to the registry maintained by ICANN.

Any domain name service provider allows you to purchase a domain name. How do you chose between them? 

Depending on your needs. If you want a site on a short term basis the cheapest service provider is great. 

If you want to maintain a brand and get additional services doing some research on hosting services combined with domain name purchases is a good investment in time.

Sometimes, you may just want to purchase a domain name and think about the rest of the process - hosting, designing and maintaining your site - after you have purchased the name. Since this takes time, it is worth just purchasing a name and not purchasing hosting at all. Once again, the cheapest service works best till you have a design, architecture and plan for your content.

## Do you build your site yourself with static site builders

Once you buy a domain name, the next tricky decision comes into play.

At this stage, many content creators jump straight into DIY mode and try and use WordPress, SquareSpace or Wix to build sites and then get unstuck because there is so much to deal with before you can create content and launch a successful site.

However, if a site is a simple calling card - says something about your business and nothing more - no content that is frequently updated (like blogs, videos, etc.) - then some of these quick-to-set-up options above make sense. They provide shared hosting that is cheap and you do not need to worry about security and site maintenance. 

As the content is static (does not change frequently) and the building of the site with the WISYWG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) tools like click and drag, text editing and formatting tools that are simple to use, an image library for logos and basic images, these options make sense.

However, if there is more that you want to do with your site, this is a trap to avoid. The reason, I called it a trap is that each of these systems have a learning curve.

Wordpress is considered a bit dated but it is quick, easy and intuitive to use. It is built on PHP, a server-side language and has many themes and standard formats to choose from. The downside is, these formats are rigid and unless you know PHP, you can not change the rigid framework that it ships with. The cheapest option - shared hosting - means you get all sorts of intrusive advertisements that have nothing to do with your site displayed. The most expensive option - full hosting - is only worth it if you think your business case needs it and you are willing to spend around $500 a year (correct at the time of writing 2022) to host your site.

Wix and SquareSpace are pretty much the same. It is a cost to carry your content and store it and maintain it and all service providers charge you for that cost. Both Wix and SquareSpace also come with their learning curve and if you want to do-it-yourself, you will learn how they set up their fixed templates and use them and figure out whether they suit your purpose.

There is unfortunately no short-cuts to trial and error - but these are expensive errors to make if you just want to build a brand, blog-site and content-site that needs your creative input and frequent updates. At some stage you will have to outsource the grunt work to a Wordpress, Wix or SquareSpace expert, either to customise the site to your requirements or to maintain the site updates as you want to focus on the creative input.

## Do you learn to code and other options

At this stage in sheer frustration, you may think you want to learn to code - do read the section on learning to code - if you want to go down this route.

As a content creator, you may want to focus on the creative work and not the grunt work and coding, though is creative in its own way, may not be something that appeals to you.

If you do not want to learn to code, what do you do next once you have purchased a name for your website?

- Research your competitors and get ideas and a look-book from their designs
- Draw your own design for how you want your site to look like
- If you can't do this yourself, get a UI-UX (user interface and user experience) designer and get a design prototype built
- Give your design to a web developer - they may use static site generators but at least you are in control of what you would like your site to look like
- If you have a complex design that requires e-commerce and users to sign up, you may need to consider security options as well
- You may want to provide a newsletter - in which case you may need to integrate plugins like an e-mail service provider to your site
- You may want social media plugins - again you may need a developer to help you with all of this.

Knowing what you want will determine what you do next. A developer may then set up static sites based on your requirements with a static site generator and manage the e-commerce, sign-in options and the social media plugins.

These add-ons are what cost you to design, build and maintain your site and make the next decision from purchasing hosting. Until you have thought all of this through, it is worth just buying the website name and not hosting while you make these decisions.
