# Learn to code - getting started

This is a jargon-free, plain English series, written to inspire people who are considering learning to code for web applications. Coding for mobile applications is a different learning path which is not covered in this blog.

It will also help non-coders, who work with coders, understand what the process is to get a feature built, into production, deployed and released on a web or mobile application.
