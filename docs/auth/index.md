# Authentication and authorisation

For users to access web applications they need to be authenticated first before they are authorised to access information or perform certain actions - like admin users updating or deleting information, users with access to financial systems integrating billing and invoicing to ERP dashboards.

This section deals with how the process often referred to, simply as auth, works - it may be a derivative and simplistic view for ease of understanding. The resources section provides key references for a more indepth view into this complex and fascinating digital challenge.
