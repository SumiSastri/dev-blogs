# History of the web

Full disclosure right up front, this conference and the topics have been doing a slow brew in my head. I looked at my own portfolio website and removed some JavaScript (might remove more), gave static-site-generators a twirl and thought they were over-engineered. Finally Just the Docs is the barest bones of HTML-CSS and Jekyll with GitHub as the host, the option I chose for my dev blogs.

That's the history of this blog site - but on to the more important topic that was discussed and the thoughts that have influenced my thinking about web development in the last year...

While the internet has been around for longer than the world-wide-web, the web in today's day and age is changing so rapidly a conference in London (2022) was an interesting post-lockdown experience and the 2-day conference focused on the history of the web, Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and challenges ahead for Web 3.0.
