# What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

GitHub a version-control system authored by Linus Torvalds, was created for Linux to manage code versions. It has now been purchased by Microsoft. 

Git is a tool that tracks changes to source code, and it's very basic. That's what it does. It tracks changes to any file actually, but it's mostly used for source code files. 

Git isn't the only version control tool around, even though it's the most popular one. Other workflow tools are Gitlab and BitBucket.

GitHub is the hub where all code is stored, reviewed. It is a public hosting site that is free for developers to host versions of their code. Repositories are created in GitHub for personal side projects and for commercial organisations to maintain their code base.
