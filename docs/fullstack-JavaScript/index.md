JavaScript was originally written and designed for frontend developers. As it has as many exceptions as it has rules, it failed to gain popularity as a programming language, until the early 2000s and now it is the fastest growing language by popularity and adoption.

JavaScript is unique in the fact that it is as popular client-side as it is server-side. It is used in gaming, web and mobile apps.
