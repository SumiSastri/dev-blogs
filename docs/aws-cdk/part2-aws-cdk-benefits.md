# Benefits

The AWS CDK allows you to use serverless microservices or infrastructure as code. 

In the AWS ecosystem, this means you can:

- generate CloudFormation templates based on code
- provides support for packaging of NodeJS lambda functions - node as the environment within which a full-stack JavaScript app can run
- it works well in a monorepo structure - more organisations are looking at shifting to monorepos from monoliths
- provides pipeline capability for continous delivery
