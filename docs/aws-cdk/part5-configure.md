# Configure

All dependencies can be installed with `npm` from the AWS V2 services.

Lerna  or `pnpm` can be used as package managers across all node-based repos

Some useful dependencies to install

s3 `npm install @aws-cdk/aws-s3 --save`
amplify `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

Once installed AWS and all dependencies have to be configured. In terminal run:

- `aws configure`
- `amplify configure`
