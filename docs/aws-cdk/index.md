# AWS-CDK

AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is ideal for a serverless infrastructure and enables you to use functions as a service (FaaS) to provision your AWS backend infrastructure.

Part of AWS' managed services suite, AWS CDK ships with methods that enable your apps to connect with AWS Cloud Formation Stacks.
