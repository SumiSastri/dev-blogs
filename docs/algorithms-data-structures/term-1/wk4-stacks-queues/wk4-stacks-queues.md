__Stack__

- A linear data structure
- Open one end - top end
- LIFO - data processing
- Allows insert/ access/ removal of elements
- top of stack is the insertion point
- isEmpty/ pop/ push/ peek operation complexity is o(1) a constant as only the top of the stack can be accessed is accessed
- Iterations - o(n2) efficiency - brute force

Use:
Parsing of expressions/ parsing balancing of parenthesis (compilers)
Recursions - call stack saves the stack data and then calls a function 
Next greater element (searching and sorting)
Element by index (accessing elements of a list)
