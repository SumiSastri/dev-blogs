# Installfest

Installfest is a great name that General Assembly used for our first day in Bootcamp.

It was the day we set up our local environment and ran some global installs. I refer to this section often to pick and mix what I need to install on my local computer depending on what I am learning and the tools required to do the job.

This section some simple set up instructions resources that I hope will help troubleshoot any global installs.
