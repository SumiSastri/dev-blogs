Unary 1 - base one

Time stamp: around 50-56 mins

Binary 2 - base 2, range is 0-1
Why use binary - a computer is a series of switches, or transistors and wires that you can switch on and off. The CPU is made up of wires and switches. However, they can be configured in such a way that all the logic we need for operations, all we need is a switch on and a switch off. Hence binary is the language of computers. The size of the transistors have shrunk in size. Only 2 states are executed as off-on switches.

Octal - base 8, is used because binary is difficult to read. Range 0-7 ideal to define permissions as only 9 options required.

In binary 100 is read-only/ 110 is read-write/ 111 is read-write-execute. Converting this to an octal. R/W/X are the alphabets representing these 4-read / 6-read-write/ 7 read-write-execute (0777, 0700) self-group-others/ self yes-group-others no/chmod 0777/ 0700/ chmod 0600

Check ls -l 7 (all have read/write/execute)
0600 (4,2, 1) read and write
0400 - read only 4 in base 8 read only
0700 - r/w/execute base 8 (421)
0100 - read only

Hexadecimal - base 16 which is 0-9 and??

Decimal - base 10, 10 to the power of 0 is 1, 10 to the power of 2 is 10 multiplied by 10 is 100, thousand is 10 to the power of 3. Base ten 0-9 is the range
