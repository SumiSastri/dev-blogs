# What is computer code

I know it is a fairly basic question to ask, but when you write code there is a whole raft of computer science terms and this section deals with some basic concepts I struggled to understand in code reviews and meetings.

I hope this section helps you out of a confused state to an informed state when you are working with a team of computer scientists or software engineers, or you are in a demo with your engineering team and some of the information seems like pure jargon.
