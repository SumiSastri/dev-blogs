# Computer programming fundamental principles

What is computer code? I know it is a fairly basic question to ask, but when you write code there are different ways of interpreting a single word in the world of computer science.

This section aims to outline some fundamental principles in computer programming, it covers the difference between binary and higher level programming languages; the basic features and data types of a programming language; how code is processed, stored and managed and provides a high-level understanding of some programming paradigms.

__Note__This section is being rewritten and is a work-in-progress.
