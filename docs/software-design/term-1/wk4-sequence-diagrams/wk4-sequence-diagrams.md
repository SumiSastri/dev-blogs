__Communication diagrams__

How objects know about each other
Structural links
Not really clear what the sequence is

__Sequence diagrams__
Most common interaction diagram
Order in which things are done - this is the one to use for project
Diagram goes fom top to bottom
objects are lined up at the top
Relationship and timelines below the objects
Relative time not the time clock
Activation bars - object is active and executing op code
Messages or methods are triggers for the object to become active (op code to be run)


__Loops and conditionals__

- UML syntax not great
- No code behaviour - only contextual information
- Some idea of what the intention is
- 2 loop frames with a conditional statement to share - even this is only one part of the frame

The loop frame is usually a boolean where the top part of the frame depicts the true validation and the bottom half the false

The return can just be a notification

The objects/ sequences should aim to match class diagram objects, data and behaviours (attributes and methods)
