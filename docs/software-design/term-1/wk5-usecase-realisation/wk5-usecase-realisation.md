__Use case realisation__

*Preconditions & Post conditions*

- How relevant to actor and the system - not just the system  (slide 4)
- Cashier
- Chefs
- Waiters

Use case realisation - how the objects interact to implement the functionality of the usecase (slide 6)
Early stage - use case/ sequence diagrams
Later stage - class diagrams and how the objects call the methods

Boundary of the usecase determines the depth of the system and requirements

(Slide 7) MVC and (slide 19)
Single responsibility objects dsiplays (boundary object) View
Data and processes(entity object) Models
Management of a task or process (control object) Control 

__Interaction diagrams__

Lifecycle of the object - goes to sleep does not get destroyed (slide 11)
This is not the place to write the coding base
It is only the prcess not the code
Not yet the place to write pseudo code
Unhappy path can be a different scenario and sequence diagram
Which objects know about each other?
The diagram must show which are related
The response does not need to know who the sender is

__Collaboration diagram__

Self link (slide 14) - the `this.checkfunds()` self call

__Static model__

Class structure and relationships is the later stage of the use case realisation
- Relate the class to the realisation in the legend at the top (slide 17) and relationship
- Slide 25 - what do the classes know about each other
- Attributes can be inffered at this stage (slide 27)

__Domain model__
Data - words - tag cloud
Association/ aggregation at this stage

Term 2 - refinement of design

The realisation of the usecase is in the sequence diagram
