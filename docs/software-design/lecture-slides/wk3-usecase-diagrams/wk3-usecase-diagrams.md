__How to arrive at use case requirements__

- BDD - behaviour driven development
- TDD - test driven development
- DDD - data driven development (static or dynamic - sequence diagram dyanamic/ class diagram static)
- Functional Requirements
- Non-functional Requirements
- [Good examples of non-functional requirements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-vs-non-functional-requirements/)

The realisation of a usecase diagram is a sequence diagram

__Course work pointers__

- Look at the data - what actions performed and what data needed to perform actions
- Look at the behaviours - sequentially
- What are the sequence of behaviours for a sequence diagram
- Sequence diagrams are details of high level taks in sequential order
- Relationships and links - gives structure to the model
- Behaviours achieve goals and solve problems that the user wants to pursue
- Functional requirements - typical interactions between user and systems
- How is a system is typically used - not all the ways the system can be used
- The capabilities of the system
- Nonfunctional requirements - out of user control to influence eg - encryptation/ etc.
- What are branch behaviours - sub-routines
- What are nice to have and what are luxury - if time do it
- Who are the actors? Use case actors describe roles not users
- Use cases are interactions between actors and the system
- Interactions follow both happy and unhappy paths - how to handle exceptions and errors
- Primary actors initiate the interaction
- Secondary actors respond to the interaction
- Every use case has a use case scenario in natural language to describe outcomes - postive/ how failures will be handled
- Unhappy path is a variation of the happy path it is a branch of the "typical" case
- Check if the stereotype is include or extend
- An actor can also be a system -eg: the ecom system that is an actor that interacts with the payment system
eg:
- Clock actors
- Ecommerce actors
- Payment gateway actors

- First show an uninteruppted flow of events in the use case scenario - happy path
- Is this only one or 2/ 3 scenarios? What are the subroutines
- What happens if things go wrong - can you matching details - of customer to payment
- What happens in the no shows scenario?
- How does the use case terminate? 
- How are you handling and showing error messages?
- How does user get back into the system?
- Log fault - large enough amount of work
- Any interactions with the system - actors
- Goals and expectations of what the system has to perform - interactions
- System boundary
- Left - Primary actor initiates the activities with the system
- Right - secondary actor
