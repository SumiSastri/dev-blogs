# Your computer - the local environment

Your computer is a synonym for a software developer's local environment. Setting up your computer with the right tools to help you code helps you link your computer to cloud based environments via the internet.

Check [how the internet works](https://sumisastri.github.io/dev-blogs/learn-to-code-getting-started/part5-how-the-internet-works/) for a quick introduction from an earlier blog post.

Cloud storage, hosts version control systems such as GitHub, as well as data-infrastructures that host your software packages and distribute them to end-users.

For [a quick overview of cloud environments](https://sumisastri.github.io/dev-blogs/data-infrastructures/part2-cloud-computing/) this link gives you a contextual background.

## What is an operating system?

The University of Wolongong, in its student resources section defines an operating system (OS), as software that manages hardware. Macs, Android and Windows have their own OSs, as do supercomputers, mobile and other smart devices.

Hardware consists of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the Random Access Memory (RAM) and the input/output (IO) drivers. 

A quick overview of how OSs work from [UWA](https://www.uow.edu.au/student/support-services/academic-skills/online-resources/technology-and-software/operating-systems/) shows you how an OS sits between hardware and your computer's software.

Computers have different system software to manage different aspects of your hardware - drivers for printers so you may print, handling files you write and store on the laptop, or access to read and edit them.

All these actions require the computer to interact with your needs as the user, the computer's software that uses the hardware's RAM and CPU. The CPU is the computing power of the hardware and how efficiently, or quickly it can handle your input and deliver an output.

So, when you buy a computer, you will often look at the specifications of CPU, RAM and storage available. Larger files - like videos need more storage and more compute power.

Software developers - especially frontend developers therefore have a bias towards purchasing Apple, with the MacOS as the speed with which graphics and design are computed are perceived to be quicker and the user interface more friendly.

However, PC users with the Windows OS, also use their PCs and the choice, or bias is often personal.

The Linux operating system, however, is not preloaded on many computers. It is an open-source OS that can be loaded on by programmers, or in the case of Apple, may be preloaded with the Ubuntu distribution system. A better understanding of how Linux is different from the MacOS or Windows OS, the article __What is Linux__ on [the official Linux site](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/), is worth a read.
