- RAM memory - 3 separate blocks of memory i/o/e
- CLI - helps you redirect file streams
On shell > redirection symbol redirect to out1 - pipes it from the screen to a file

Bash is a way to see how the processes work

- When you use the cd command the stack pointer traverses through the folder structure and locates your file
- dot/ 2 dot files - dot current file/ 2 dots 2 levels above
- cd and the dots and forward slashes show you the path the stack pointer is taking you to traverse through your folder structure
- the tilda takes you straight back to the home directory - it is like an exit command

Binary
01 - base 2
Octals -8 bits or 1 byte - base -18
Hexadecimal - digita 1-9 and letters a-f - base 16
Base 32
Base 64
Not yet at 128 bit machine

So in the case of Bash Scripts - when write chmod + rwe the letters in Hexadecimals need to be converted to Octals and then into binary

Why?
Everything needs to get converted back to binary for memory management
421
100

Reads octals left to right and binary right to left
Multiply
4x1 + 0 + 0 = 4
Because it is octal and only 3 places you pad left
0400 is 100 in binary

If you provide 0444 then you give everyone permission to read
421
110
4+2+0 is 06 so 0666 gives everyone read/ write permission

421
111
4+2+1 is 7
07 in octals and 0777 you are giving everyone permission to read/write and execute

What is checksum or the cyclical redundancy check using Modulus - checks if odd or even in cycles
Till you get to 0 to ensure that the file can be run
