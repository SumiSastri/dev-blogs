(a) What is the main property of a Binary Search Tree (BST)? [2 marks]
(b) Create a BST by inserting the following list of integers:
50, 30, 61, 48, 17, 72, 66, 91
one number at a time, in the order given, into an initially empty BST.
Illustrate the result of each insertion by drawing the BST after each inser-
tion, i.e. 8 BST diagrams in total. [6 marks]
(c) Using your Ô¨Ånal BST from part (b) as the current state of the tree, then
assume the number 50 has been deleted from it using the BST deletion operation, thus resulting in a BST with all the original numbers except 50.
Draw the state of this resultant BST after 50 has been deleted from it. [2 marks]

- BST is a special type of binary tree where the the data is ordered and sorted
- The left node always has values smaller than the values of the right node
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be BSTs
