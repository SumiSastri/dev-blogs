__Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms__
1. **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort** – Selects the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to its correct position.
3. **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
4. **Merge Sort** – Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.
5. **Quick Sort** – Uses a pivot to partition the array into smaller and larger elements, then sorts recursively.
6. **Heap Sort** – Converts the array into a heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum or minimum element.
7. **Shell Sort** – A variation of insertion sort that sorts elements far apart before finalizing with a normal insertion sort.
8. **Tim Sort** – A hybrid sorting algorithm used in Python, combining merge sort and insertion sort.
9. **Intro Sort** – A hybrid of quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort, used in C++’s STL.
