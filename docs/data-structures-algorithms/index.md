# DSA - data structures and algorithms 

Data structures are essential for managing, accessing, storing, and processing data efficiently. They provide both a formal and abstract definition of how data is organized and manipulated in computer programs. Efficient data structures are crucial for reducing costs associated with data processing and transportation. Algorithms are prdered ways to process and manage data.

This section discusses the relationship between data structures and algorithms and how time efficiency is managed with some key data-structures such as linear data types, graphs and trees.
