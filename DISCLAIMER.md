## DISCLAIMER

My dev blogs are for guidance only, and a part of my self-education. If there are errors, they are entirely my fault so please do your research.

I have only been a web developer for a few years and there are many people better suited to write more eruditely on the subject.  I am currently studying for a Masters in Computer Science at Westminster University. These docs are primarily a study guide written in plain English and explain, where possible, industry jargon.

I am experimenting with adding reading references and resources to these blogs where approprite. Many references are added without academia in mind. These references are a list of links to sources of information that readers may find useful.

If you find any information incomplete or incorrect connect with me on Linked-in or GitHub. I am always happy to collaborate and be corrected :-). This is a work in progress, so not all sections are updated with citations, references and links.
